# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

This project is intentionally small and opinionated.  
Please keep changes aligned with the core principles.

## Principles

- Minimal UI
- No accounts, no backend
- No priorities, tags, or analytics
- Prefer clarity over features
- Weekly planning first

If a feature adds complexity, it probably doesn’t belong.

## Ways to contribute

- UX / interaction improvements
- Bug fixes
- Drag & drop edge cases
- Visual polish (spacing, typography)
- Month / week view ergonomics
- Performance improvements

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make changes
4. Open a pull request with:
   - what problem you’re solving
   - why it fits the project philosophy

## Non-goals

Please do not propose:
- user accounts
- cloud sync
- notifications
- priorities, tags, labels
- analytics or tracking

These are intentionally out of scope.

## Discussion

If unsure whether something fits, open an issue first and describe the idea.
