# Minimal Week Planner

A minimalist personal planning app focused on **weekly flow**, not task management overhead.

No accounts.  
No backend.  
No priorities, tags, or analytics.  
This is not a productivity system (no GTD, no Kanban, no analytics, no teams).
Just writing things down and moving them around.

## Features

- Inbox for quick capture
- Weekly view (Mon–Sun) with inline editing
- Monthly view with draggable day lists
- Todos and notes (completed items stay visible)
- Drag & drop:
  - reorder within a day
  - move between days
  - move across weeks/months
- Week-level notes
- Fully localStorage-based (your data stays in your browser)

## Why this exists

Most task tools optimize for:
- tracking
- prioritizing
- measuring

This tool optimizes for:
- **thinking**
- **weekly planning**
- **lightweight structure**

It’s closer to a paper planner than a task manager.
